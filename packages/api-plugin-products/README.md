## Summary

Products plugin for the [Reaction API](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction)

### Example on how to use Filter Conditions

We have a query endpoint defined in this plugin which allows us to query products collection based on the input GraphQL conditions object. This query endpoint is defined as `filterProducts.js` and it calls the `generateFilterQuery` function from the `api-utils` plugin to generate the MongoDB filter query.

The `generateFilterQuery` function expects the input GraphQL conditions object to be in the format of the `FilterConditionsInput` input type defined in the GraphQL Schemas (in api-core plugin) along with other parameters like `context`, `collectionName` and `shopId`.

Please go through a general introduction of how to use this function which can be found in the [api-utils README](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/tree/trunk/packages/api-utils/docs) before going through the examples below on how to use this function in the context of the `products` plugin.

In the query endpoint, we pass the `FilterConditionsInput` input type object as the `conditions` argument. This object is passed to the `generateFilterQuery` function along with other parameters like `context`, `collectionName` and `shopId` to generate the MongoDB filter query. The `generateFilterQuery` function is generic and can be used to generate filter queries for any collection. Since the parameters like `context`, `collectionName` and `shopId` are pretty self-explanatory, we shall focus on explaining the various ways in which the `conditions` object can be used.

1. Single condition.
Here we are querying products collection for entries with the handle as 'mens-waterproof-outdoor-rain-jacket'. Since it is single condition, using either `all` or `any` will not make difference. 

```js
import generateFilterQuery from "@reactioncommerce/api-utils/generateFilterQuery.js";

const conditions = {
      all: [
        {
          any:[
            {
              key: "handle",
              stringValue: "mens-waterproof-outdoor-rain-jacket",
              relationalOperator: eq,
              logicalNot: false
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }

  const { filterQuery } = generateFilterQuery(context, "Product", conditions, shopId);

  return Products.find(filterQuery);
```
<br>

2. Two conditions.

Here we are querying products collection for entries which have either the handle as 'mens-waterproof-outdoor-rain-jacket' or 'title' begins with the text 'men'. Since we are using the `any` to connect the conditions, it translates to a mongo DB `$or` condition. Please note that the top level `all` condition is only to maintain the structure of the input GraphQL conditions object. It does not impact the results of the inner query.


```js
import generateFilterQuery from "@reactioncommerce/api-utils/generateFilterQuery.js";

const conditions = {
      all: [
        {
          any:[
            {
              key: "handle",
              stringValue: "mens-waterproof-outdoor-rain-jacket",
              relationalOperator: eq,
              logicalNot: false
            }, 
            {
              key: "title",
              stringValue: "men",
              relationalOperator: beginsWith,
              logicalNot: false
              caseSensitive: false
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }

  const { filterQuery } = generateFilterQuery(context, "Product", conditions, shopId);

  return Products.find(filterQuery);
```
<br>

3. Multiple conditions.

Here we are querying products collection for entries which confirms to multiple conditions.
We have 3 distinct group of conditions in the inner level and the results of all these 3 are joined at the top level with `all` meaning `$and` in MongoDB.

The first group looks for entries matching either of the conditions `handle` as 'mens-waterproof-outdoor-rain-jacket' or `title` begins with the text 'men'. Since we are using the `any` to connect the conditions, it translates to a mongo DB `$or` condition.

The second group looks for entries matching the `_id` in the array `["DZwLHk4EAzitRni8F", "Hn4BRaBvLkYffMq36"]` and `isDeleted` as `false` and `workflow.status` as `new`. Since we are using the `all` to connect the conditions, it translates to a mongo DB `$and` condition.

The third group looks for entries matching the `price.min` greater than 19.99 and `type` as `simple`. Since we are using the `all` to connect the conditions, it translates to a mongo DB `$and` condition.

As explained above, the final results are joined at the top level with `all` meaning `$and` in MongoDB.

```js
import generateFilterQuery from "@reactioncommerce/api-utils/generateFilterQuery.js";

const conditions = {
      all: [
        {
          any:[
            {
              key: "handle",
              stringValue: "mens-waterproof-outdoor-rain-jacket",
              relationalOperator: eq,
              logicalNot: false
            }, 
            {
              key: "title",
              stringValue: "men",
              relationalOperator: beginsWith,
              logicalNot: false
              caseSensitive: false
            }
          ]
        },
        {
          all:[
            {
              key: "_id",
              stringArrayValue: ["DZwLHk4EAzitRni8F", "Hn4BRaBvLkYffMq36"],
              relationalOperator: in,
              logicalNot: false
            },
            {
              key: "isDeleted",
              booleanValue: false,
              relationalOperator: eq,
              logicalNot: false
            },
            {
              key: "workflow.status",
              stringValue: "new",
              relationalOperator: eq,
              logicalNot: false
            }
          ]
        },
        {
          all:[
            {
              key: "price.min",
              floatValue: 19.99,
              relationalOperator: gte,
              logicalNot: false
            },
            {
              key: "type",
              stringValue: "simple",
              relationalOperator: eq,
              logicalNot: false
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }

  const { filterQuery } = generateFilterQuery(context, "Product", conditions, shopId);

  return Products.find(filterQuery);
