# @reactioncommerce/db-version-check

An NPM package that provides migrations for use with the `@reactioncommerce/migrator` CLI tool should use this package to check whether data is at the correct version before running any database commands.

## Usage

This package exports only one function: `doesDatabaseVersionMatch`.

```js
import doesDatabaseVersionMatch from "@reactioncommerce/db-version-check";

const ok = await doesDatabaseVersionMatch({
  // `db` is a Db instance from the `mongodb` NPM package,
  // such as what is returned when you do `client.db()`
  db,
  // These must match one of the namespaces and versions
  // your package exports in the `migrations` named export
  expectedVersion: 2,
  namespace: "my-package-name",
  // Defines what to do if no current version is found for this track in
  // the database. By default, the check will fail. That is, we will assume
  // that some data must need to be migrated. If you have a way of checking
  // whether it's an empty database or confirming that no migrations are
  // needed, you can do that and pass `true` here. Then the check will
  // succeed and the current version for the track will be set to
  // `expectedVersion`. Alternatively, pass a function that returns
  // a Promise that returns `true` or `false`. This way you can avoid
  // database lookups unless a decision is necessary.
  async setToExpectedIfMissing() {
    const anyAccount = await db.collection("Accounts").findOne();
    // If there are no accounts, it's probably a brand new database
    // so we can assume all our data will be at the latest version
    // and mark it as such in the database.
    return !anyAccount;
  }
});

if (!ok) {
  throw new Error('Database needs migrating. The "my-package-name" namespace must be at version 2.');
}
```
