You can sign your commit automatically with Git by using `git commit -s` if you have your `user.name` and `user.email` set as part of your Git configuration.

We use the [Probot DCO GitHub app](https://github.com/apps/dco) to check for DCO signoffs of every commit.

If you forget to sign your commits, the DCO bot will remind you and give you detailed instructions for how to amend your commits to add a signature.
