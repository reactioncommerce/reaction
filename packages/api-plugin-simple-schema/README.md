## Summary

SimpleSchema plugin for the [Reaction API](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction).

The [SimpleSchema](https://github.com/aldeed/simple-schema-js) package is used by many plugins to validate data, often before inserting or updating MongoDB documents. To allow other plugins to extend these schemas, some plugins register them such that they are accessible in a `preStartup` function.

## Installation

```sh
npm install @reactioncommerce/api-plugin-simple-schema
```

Then add a reference in `plugins.json`, using any key you want. The order in which plugins appear in this file is the order in which they load.

```json
{
  "simpleSchema": "@reactioncommerce/api-plugin-simple-schema"
}
```

## Usage

Here's an example of registering a schema:

```js
import SimpleSchema from "simpl-schema";

const ProductSchema = new SimpleSchema({
  // ...
});

export default async function register(app) {
  await app.registerPlugin({
    // ...
    simpleSchemas: {
      Product: ProductSchema,
    },
  });
}
```

Note that a plugin creating a SimpleSchema instance as in the above example will also need to list the `simpl-schema` NPM package as a dependency.

And on the other side, if you have a plugin that wants to extend some of the schemas provided by other plugins, do it in a `preStartup` function:

```js
export default function preStartup(context) {
  context.simpleSchemas.Product.extend({
    price: PriceRange,
  });
}
```

This could be done in a `startup` function, but because startup code sometimes validates against these schemas, it's safer to do it in a `preStartup` function.

A plugin that extends schemas but never calls `new SimpleSchema()` anywhere need not list the `simpl-schema` NPM package as a dependency.
