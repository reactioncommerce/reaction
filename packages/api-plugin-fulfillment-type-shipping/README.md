# api-plugin-fulfillment-type-shipping

This is a fulfillment-type plugin which which works along with the base `api-plugin-fulfillment` and other fulfillment-method plugins (like flat-rate-shipping, dynamic-rate-shipping etc). This plugin provides the basic updates needed to establish the fulfillment-type.

Each of the newly introduced fulfillment-method plugins under this fulfillment-type (shipping) would need to bee implemented as separate plugins. 

This plugins does the following:
* Registers the 'shipping' as a ff-type via registeredFulfillmentTypes: ["shipping"]
* Inserts the default entry for shipping ff-type in Fulfillment collection
