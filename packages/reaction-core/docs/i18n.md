#Internationalization (i18n)
##i18n 
We use the (http://i18next.com/)[http://i18next.com/] i18n library for translations.

 - usage - inline tag: <td data-i18n='cartSubTotals.items'>
 - usage - in template: {{i18n 'cartDrawer.empty'}}
 - usage - reference:  <thead data-i18n>cartSubTotals.head</thead>
 - usage - implied tag: <td data-i18n>Item Count</td>

Fallback translations should go in core-dev.json, and will cascade to other language files if they are missing entries.
```
<thead data-i18n='cartSubTotals.head'>Your cart</thead>
```

This will first use "Your cart", then will fetch translations from the `Translations` collection. IE for English, will look in core-en.json for 
```
{
  "cartSubTotals": {
    "head": "Your cart"
    }
}
```

If it's not found there, we'll fallback to core-dev.json and see if there is an entry, otherwise we'll just use the text value "Your cart" (unchanged content).

Each package should have it's own namespaced translation files.

## Fixture Data
Initial translation data that gets loaded with a new shop is located in `reaction-core/private/data/Translations.json`

Every package that supplies translations should add a fixture for translations that add their own namespace (ie: helloworld), and insert initial translations into the `translations` collection.


*See reaction-core/i18n/core-dev.json* for example definition/translation

##Guidelines

###Don't crowd the UI. 
Dialogs should be constructed with at least 30% (preferably 100%) expansion room in mind. If this becomes impossible, a second dialog or a tabbed interface must be implemented.

###Use ToolTips. 
All buttons / icons should use ToolTips and/or status bar messages (if possible)

###Write in complete sentences. 
String resources should be composed of complete sentences or phrases; concatenated strings should be minimized.

###Comment your resources. 
Include comments in your resource files (if possible), especially for unusual terms or phrases, for resources that must not be translated, or for resources which must only be translated in a particular way.
