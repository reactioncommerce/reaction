#Internationalization (i18n)
##i18n 
We use the (http://i18next.com/)[http://i18next.com/] i18n library for translations.

 - usage - inline tag: `<td data-i18n='cartSubTotals.items'>`
 - usage - in template: `{{i18n 'cartDrawer.empty'}}`
 - usage - reference:  `<thead data-i18n>cartSubTotals.head</thead>`
 - usage - implied tag: `<td data-i18n>Item Count</td>`
 - usage - alerts `Alerts.add "Message!", "danger", i18n_key: "productDetail.outOfStock"`
 - usage - js `i18n.t(gridPackage.pkgDisabled)`

*Keys should be camelCase, no spaces, no periods.*

The fallback language is EN, so all new translations should go in `reaction-core/private/data/i18n/en.json`, and will fallback to English for other language files if they are missing entries.

```
<thead data-i18n='cartSubTotals.head'>Your cart</thead>
```

This will first use "Your cart", then will fetch translations from the `Translations` collection. IE for English, will look in `en` for 

```
{
  "cartSubTotals": {
    "head": "Your cart"
    }
}
```

If there is no entry in English dictionary, we'll just use the text value from the template.

## Fixture Data
Initial translation data that gets loaded with a new shop is located in `private/data/i18n/*.json`

Every package that supplies translations should add a fixture for translations that add their own namespace (ie: helloworld), and insert initial translations into the `translations` collection.

TODO: *Each package should have it's own namespaced translation files.*


##Guidelines

###Don't crowd the UI. 
Dialogs should be constructed with at least 30% (preferably 100%) expansion room in mind. If this becomes impossible, a second dialog or a tabbed interface must be implemented.

###Use ToolTips. 
All buttons / icons should use ToolTips and/or status bar messages (if possible)

###Write in complete sentences. 
String resources should be composed of complete sentences or phrases; concatenated strings should be minimized.
