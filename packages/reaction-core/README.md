See [Meteor Docs](http://docs.meteor.com) for introduction to [Meteor](http://meteor.com).

Read [Meteor Style Guide](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/wiki/Meteor-Style-Guide) for format and style of contributions.

Our core is being built with a preference for Coffeescript + LESS.

We are always using latest full release of all community packages.

## Issues and Roadmap
For development tasks/issues please use the [Reaction project issues](https://github.com/ongoworks/reaction/issues?state=open). We're keeping this as the central issue tracking for all our packages.

To review our roadmap, take a look at the vision page [Reaction Vision](http://reactioncommerce.com/vision)
