# Contributing

At Reaction Commerce, we're dedicated to the open source community. In fact, we've designed our entire platform and business to grow from the passion and creativity that an open source community ignites. We've already attracted a small, dedicated team of open source contributors, and there's always room for more. If you'd like to join us, here's how to get started:

**Step 1:**  If you haven't already, get Reaction running locally:

```sh
curl https://install.meteor.com | /bin/sh
git clone https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction.git
cd reaction
reaction
```

**Step 2:**

Explore the interface and the code to give you a good overview of the product and a sense for what's already built. Keep an eye out for bugs and interface issues, as well as features you'd like to see created.

**Step 3:**

Explore the [GitHub issues already open on our main repo](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/issues) and our [GitHub project boards](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/projects). If you find something you want to work on, let us know right there in the comments. [`Pull Requests Encouraged`](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Apull-requests-encouraged) and [`Verified Reproducible`](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Averified-reproducible) labeled issues are a great place to start.

If you are interested in a specific aspect of the project but aren't sure where to begin, feel free to ask. Start small and open up a dialogue with us. This will help to get your contributions accepted easily.

**Step 4:**

Let us know how we can make the contribution process easier. We want to find the best ways to support you.
