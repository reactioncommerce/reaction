Black Tie License

This license (“Agreement”) is a legal contract between you (“Licensee”) and Fonticons (“Licensor”).
By purchasing, downloading, using, or copying any image or part thereof, from the internet or by any other method, of
any icons, symbols, or pictograms (“Product”) licensed by Fonticons, you automatically agree to the following terms and
conditions:

Definitions
“Product” is defined as any part or whole of one or more icons, symbols, or pictographic images in vector, raster,
and/or font formats. “Webfont” is defined as font software that has been created, optimized, translated or otherwise
modified for use by means of transmitting via the Internet for use in the viewing of text on a website. By way of
explanation, not limitation, such uses can be implemented by means of the CSS @font-face rule. Other technology or
software implementations used to effect similar results may apply and such uses or methods shall be governed by this
Agreement.

Grant of Agreement
Number of Users Licensor grants the Licensee a non-exclusive license to use the Product. The maximum number of
simultaneous users is limited to five (5). All users must belong to the same company or household purchasing the
Product.

Embedding You may embed the licensed fonts into documents you send to third parties. Such documents may be viewed and
printed (but not edited) by the recipients.

You may embed the licensed fonts into software, including but not limited to websites and mobile applications. However,
you may not redistribute or transfer the Product to end users or third parties through your software or by any means. An
additional license is required if the software permits editing of text by end users or third parties.

Back-up You may make a reasonable number of back-up copies of the Product for archival purposes only. Copies must
contain the same documentation, copyright, trademark, and other proprietary notices that appear on, in, or with the
Product.

Service Bureaus You may take a digitized copy of the Product used in a particular document to a commercial print or
service bureau for outputting this (a) particular document (this document must not be edited by the printer or service
bureau). In the event of any modifications to the document or use of the Product for other purposes, the printer or
service bureau must purchase its own Product license.

Copying Except for Embedding and Service Bureaus, you may not copy the Product or allow third parties to copy the
Product. Any copy of the Product must contain the same copyright, trademark, and other proprietary information as the
originals.

Modifications You may import characters from the font as graphical objects into a drawing program and modify such
graphical objects.

You may not modify, adapt, translate, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or create derivative works based on the
licensed font itself without Fonticons’s prior written consent.

Transfer of License
Except as expressly provided herein, you may not give, rent, or lease the Product or parts of it to third parties. You
may transfer all your rights to use the Product and Documentation to another person or legal entity provided that:

  - The Transferee accepts and agrees in writing (with copy to Licensee) to be bound by all the terms and conditions of
    this Agreement, and
  - You destroy all copies of the Product and Documentation, including all copies stored in the memory of a hardware
    device. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, you agree that you will not distribute or disseminate all
    or any part of the Product through any online service.

Refund Policy
No refund will be offered for products once sold. Because they are digital files, all symbols are not refundable or
exchangeable. However files can be replaced if damaged or lost.

Copyright
The font and the accompanying materials are copyrighted and contain proprietary information and trade secrets belonging
to the designer owning the font. Unauthorized copying of the Product (even if modified, merged, or included with other
software), or of the written materials, is expressly forbidden. You may be held legally responsible for any infringement
of the foundry’s intellectual property rights that is caused or encouraged by your failure to abide by the terms of this
Agreement.

Disclaimer & Warranty
All licensed Products are provided ‘as-is’ without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied. Licensor is not
liable for any damages arising out of any defects in the materials. You agree to hold Licensor harmless for any result
that may occur during the course of using, or inability to use these licensed Products. In no event shall Licensor be
liable for any damages including, but not limited to, direct, indirect, special, incidental or consequential damages or
other losses arising out of the use of or inability to use the Products.

Reserved Rights
We reserve rights to change the prices of the Product and to update the Product without prior notice and at our sole
discretion. We reserve the rights to make changes to this Agreement without any prior notice at our sole discretion. Any
such changes will be reflected on this page.

Governing Law & General Provisions
This Agreement will be governed by the laws in force in the United States of America and Massachusetts excluding the
application of its conflicts of law rules. This agreement will not be governed by the United Nations Convention of
Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, the application of which is expressly excluded. If any part of this
Agreement is found void and unenforceable, it will not affect the validity of the balance of the Agreement, which shall
remain valid and enforceable according to its terms. You agree that the Product(s) will not be shipped, transferred, or
exported into any country or used in any manner prohibited by export administration legislation or any other export
laws, restrictions, or regulations.

Termination
Fonticons has the right to terminate your license immediately if you fail to comply with any term of this Agreement.
